How to use ResearchDrive?
*************************

ResearchDrive is using the Owncloud software. Fortunately, Owncloud provides extensive online documentation on how to use it. It may be found at: `Owncloud User Manual`_.

Although the Owncloud manual gives to a lot information, we have added some stuff here in order to get you going quickly.

.. note:: **Important:** We have not turned on all features that are described in the Owncloud User Manual, so you may find features there that are not supported (yet) by ResearchDrive.
