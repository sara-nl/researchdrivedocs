Getting access to Research Drive
********************************

In this page you will find general information about getting access to the Research Drive.

If you are interested to Research Drive, please contact the `SURFsara helpdesk`_ (helpdesk@surfsara.nl).


Currently, we support two types of accounts

- Accounts that are stored in SURFsara's Central User Administration (CUA) system. The advantage is these accounts are that when you use other SURFsara services, you can use the same set of credentials for all services.
- Local accounts.

What we are working on at the moment is to enable you to use your account of your own institute through `SURFconext`_.
