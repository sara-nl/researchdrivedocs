How to couple external storage
******************************

It is possible to connect external storage to your ReserachDrive account. This allows you also to share data residing on external storage with user who do not have access to that storage. 

Currently the following external storage systems are supported: Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Openstack Object Storage (SWIFT), ownCloud, SFTP and WebDAV. 

The video below shows you how to connect to `SURFsara's S3 Object Store`_ system.

.. note:: **Important:** Your credentials that you have to provide to get access to the external storage system will be stored on the ResearchDrive systems. Of course we do everything in our power to keep them secure and to avoid misuse.
